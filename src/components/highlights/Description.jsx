          Follow the sound of music through Golden Gate Park to discover Outside
          Lands – a celebration of everything we love about the Bay Area. It’s a
          party for all five senses, combining an eclectic lineup with world
          class art, food, wine and more. As it evolves with groundbreaking
          experiences like Grass Lands and mind-expanding talks at D.A.V.E,
          Outside Lands continues to shine as a festival that’s totally original
          and 100% San Francisco.
